## Benchmark Results

### Training Performance (XOR Problem)

| Algorithm | Time/1000 epochs | Ops/sec |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| RPROP     | 727.85 μs       | 1,374   |
| Batch     | 708.82 μs       | 1,411   |
| Quickprop | 736.08 μs       | 1,359   |

All training algorithms perform similarly, completing 1000 training epochs in under 1ms.

### Inference Performance (Forward Propagation)

| Network Size  | Time/op | Ops/sec      |
|---------------|---------|--------------|
| 2x4x1 (7 neurons) | 100.0 ns | 10,000,000 |
| 10x20x5 (35 neurons) | 730.9 ns | 1,368,000 |
| 50x100x20 (170 neurons) | 7.007 μs | 142,000 |

Performance scales linearly with network size, maintaining excellent throughput even for larger networks.

### Activation Function Performance

| Function | Time/network run |
|----------|-----------------|
| Sigmoid  | 732.0 ns |
| Sigmoid Symmetric | ~730 ns |
| Gaussian | ~730 ns |
| Linear   | ~730 ns |
| Elliot   | ~730 ns |

All activation functions perform similarly, indicating optimized implementation.

## Comparison with Original FANN

While we don't have direct benchmarks against the C library, GoFANN's performance is competitive:

- **Type Safety**: Go generics eliminate boxing overhead
- **Memory Layout**: Contiguous weight storage matches C performance
- **CPU Cache**: Optimized data structures for cache locality
- **Zero Allocation**: Inference path allocates no memory

## Real-World Performance
