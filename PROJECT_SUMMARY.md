## Future Potential

The foundation is set for:
- GPU acceleration
- Advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop)
- Streaming data support
- Self-doubt validation layers
- Integration with larger systems

## Philosophy

Following Lane Cunningham's insight:
> "A tiny model that understands itself beats a large model that doesn't"

GoFANN proves that small, specialized, self-aware networks can solve real problems efficiently on CPU, making AI accessible for edge computing and embedded systems.
