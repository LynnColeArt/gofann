# Cascade Training Issues Found During QA

## Issue 1: Network Output Decays to Zero

During cascade output training, the network output rapidly decays to zero, regardless of the target value. This happens within 20-30 epochs.

### Symptoms:
- Initial output: 0.472 (close to target 0.5)
- After 10 epochs: 0.359
- After 20 epochs: 0.030
- After 30 epochs: ~0 (5e-10)
- MSE increases from 0.0008 to 0.25

### Possible Causes:
1. **Gradient calculation issue** - The error gradients might be calculated incorrectly for partial network updates
2. **RPROP step sizes** - Even with reduced defaults, RPROP might be too aggressive
3. **Missing bias update** - Cascade might not be handling bias neurons correctly
4. **Weight initialization** - New connections might start with bad values

## Issue 2: Cascade Makes Simple Problems Worse

On simple problems like learning a constant output (0.5) or single training samples, cascade training makes the MSE worse rather than better.

## Issue 3: XOR Performance

The cascade-trained XOR network outputs all zeros, suggesting complete network failure rather than just poor performance.

## Recommendations:

1. **Use simpler training for output layer** - Consider using basic gradient descent with small learning rate instead of RPROP
2. **Add debugging output** - Log weight changes and gradients during cascade training
3. **Test with standard networks first** - Verify the output-only training works on regular networks
4. **Consider the cascade correlation algorithm** - The current implementation might be missing key aspects of the original Cascade-Correlation algorithm

## Note on Implementation

The cascade implementation is functionally complete but appears to have algorithmic issues that prevent it from learning effectively. All the infrastructure is in place:
- Candidate neuron training
- Network topology modification  
- Parameter configuration
- Weight preservation

The issue appears to be in the learning dynamics rather than the structure.
